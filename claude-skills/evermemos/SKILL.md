# EverMemOS Memory Integration

This skill enables Claude Code to use EverMemOS as a persistent memory backend, allowing you to search past conversations, store important information, and fetch recent history.

## Available Commands

### 🔍 Search Memories

Search for relevant memories based on a query. Use this to recall past conversations, decisions, bugs, or any historical context.

**Syntax:**
```
/evermemos search <query> [method] [top_k]
```

**Parameters:**
- `query` (required): Search query text
- `method` (optional): Retrieval method - `keyword`, `vector`, `hybrid` (default), `rrf`, or `agentic`
- `top_k` (optional): Maximum results to return (default: 5)

**When to use:**
- User asks "What did we discuss about X?"
- User references past work: "Remember that bug we fixed?"
- Need project context before implementing features
- Recall past decisions or approaches

**Example:**
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/evermemos/scripts/evermemos_client.py search "$ARGUMENTS[1]" "${2:-hybrid}" "${3:-5}"
```

---

### 💾 Store Memory

Store **structured summaries, conclusions, or AI-generated insights** into EverMemOS for future reference.

**IMPORTANT:** User messages are already auto-saved by UserPromptSubmit hook. Use this command to store:
- **AI's summaries and conclusions** (not raw user messages)
- **Structured important information** extracted from conversations
- **Key learnings and insights** discovered during work

**Syntax:**
```
/evermemos store <content> [role]
```

**Parameters:**
- `content` (required): Structured content to store (summary, conclusion, insight)
- `role` (optional): `user` or `assistant` (default: assistant for AI insights)

**When to use:**
- ✅ You (Claude) discover a critical bug → Store a structured bug report
- ✅ Important decisions are made → Store the decision summary
- ✅ New patterns are established → Store the pattern description
- ✅ Project milestones reached → Store the milestone summary
- ✅ User asks to remember a **specific fact or conclusion** (not their raw message)
- ❌ DON'T: Store raw user messages (already auto-saved by hook)

**Example:**
```bash
# Good: Store structured insight
/evermemos store "Bug fix: async_streaming_bulk fails with timeout >30s. Solution: Use sync_bulk for large batches." assistant

# Good: Store conclusion
/evermemos store "Decision: Use hybrid retrieval as default method for balance of speed and accuracy." assistant

# Bad: Don't do this (user message already auto-saved)
# /evermemos store "Remember that we use hybrid retrieval" user
```

---

### 📜 Recent History

Fetch recent conversation history from EverMemOS to understand current context.

**Syntax:**
```
/evermemos recent [limit]
```

**Parameters:**
- `limit` (optional): Number of recent memories to fetch (default: 10)

**When to use:**
- User asks "What were we working on?"
- Need to recap recent activities
- Resuming work after a break
- Understanding conversation flow

**Example:**
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/evermemos/scripts/evermemos_client.py recent "${1:-10}"
```

---

## Automatic Usage Guidelines

Claude should **PROACTIVELY and AUTOMATICALLY** use this skill in the following scenarios:

### 🔍 CRITICAL: Search BEFORE Answering

**ALWAYS search memories FIRST when:**
- User asks ANY question that MIGHT benefit from historical context
- Before implementing features (check past approaches and decisions)
- When debugging (check similar past issues and solutions)
- Before suggesting solutions (verify against past experience)
- When user mentions technical terms we've discussed before

→ **Default Action:** When in doubt, SEARCH FIRST, then answer

### 1. User Asks About Past Events ⭐ ALWAYS TRIGGER
- "What did we discuss about ES sync yesterday?"
- "Did we fix that authentication bug?"
- "What approach did we decide on for caching?"
- ANY question containing: "last time", "before", "previously", "earlier", "remember"

→ **Action:** Use `/evermemos search "<relevant keywords>"` IMMEDIATELY

### 2. User References Previous Work ⭐ ALWAYS TRIGGER
- "Remember that API design pattern we used?"
- "Like we did last time with the database migration"
- "Similar to the bug we encountered before"
- ANY reference to past conversations or work

→ **Action:** Search for relevant context BEFORE responding

### 3. Technical Questions That May Have Context ⭐ PROACTIVE SEARCH
Even if user doesn't explicitly mention history, PROACTIVELY search when:
- User asks about project architecture or design patterns
- User asks how something works in THIS project
- User asks for implementation suggestions
- User reports a bug or issue
- User asks "how do I..." in context of current project

**Examples:**
- "How should I implement authentication?" → Search: "authentication implementation design"
- "This API call is failing" → Search: "API bug error failure"
- "What's the best way to cache?" → Search: "caching strategy decision"

→ **Action:** Search first, then provide context-aware answer

### 4. User Wants to Remember Something ⭐ EXTRACT AND STORE
When user says "Remember this" or "Make a note":
- "Remember this for later"
- "Make a note that we use hybrid retrieval"
- "Keep in mind that async_streaming_bulk has a bug"

**IMPORTANT:** User's raw message is ALREADY auto-saved by UserPromptSubmit hook!

→ **Action:** Extract the KEY FACT and store it as a structured memory:

**Example:**
```
User: "Remember that we use hybrid retrieval for this project"

❌ DON'T: /evermemos store "Remember that we use hybrid retrieval" user
   (This duplicates the auto-saved user message)

✅ DO: /evermemos store "Project configuration: Default retrieval method is hybrid (combines keyword + vector search for balanced performance)" assistant
   (This stores a structured, actionable fact)
```

### 5. Important Decisions or Discoveries ⭐ AUTO-STORE STRUCTURED INFO
When you (Claude) identify during conversation:
- Critical bugs and their fixes
- Architectural decisions made
- Performance optimizations discovered
- Security issues found
- New patterns or conventions established
- Important configuration or setup steps

→ **Action:** AUTOMATICALLY store a structured summary (as assistant role)

**Example:**
```
During conversation, you discover a bug:

✅ DO: /evermemos store "Bug: ES sync fails when document count >10k. Root cause: bulk_size too large. Solution: Set bulk_size=1000 and use scroll API." assistant

❌ DON'T: Just acknowledge without storing
```

**Note:** Raw conversation messages (user & assistant) are already auto-saved by hooks. Use store for **structured, actionable summaries** only.

### 6. Context Recovery ⭐ ALWAYS TRIGGER
- User returns after a break
- New conversation but related to previous work
- Need to understand project history
- User asks "What were we working on?"

→ **Action:** Fetch recent history to understand context

### 7. Before Major Code Changes ⭐ PROACTIVE SEARCH
Before writing significant code:
- Search for similar implementations: `/evermemos search "<feature name>"`
- Search for related bugs: `/evermemos search "bug <component>"`
- Search for design decisions: `/evermemos search "design <topic>"`
- Search for past patterns: `/evermemos search "pattern <concept>"`

→ **Action:** Gather context BEFORE implementing

### 8. When User Mentions Specific Components ⭐ PROACTIVE SEARCH
If user mentions specific files, modules, or components:
- "Can you look at the authentication module?"
- "There's an issue with the API handler"
- "Update the database schema"

→ **Action:** Search for past work on that component FIRST

**Example:**
User: "Can you update the API handler?"
You:
1. `/evermemos search "API handler implementation"`
2. `/evermemos search "API bug fix"`
3. Review results, then respond with context-aware solution

---

## 🚀 Proactive Search Strategy

### When to Search EVEN IF User Doesn't Ask

Claude should **automatically and proactively** search in these scenarios WITHOUT waiting for explicit user request:

#### Scenario A: Technical Questions About THIS Project
```
User: "How does authentication work in this system?"
```
**Before answering:**
1. `/evermemos search "authentication implementation"`
2. `/evermemos search "auth design pattern"`
3. Review results, then provide answer based on actual project history

#### Scenario B: Feature Implementation Requests
```
User: "Add a caching layer to the API"
```
**Before implementing:**
1. `/evermemos search "caching implementation"`
2. `/evermemos search "API performance"`
3. Check if caching was discussed/tried before
4. Use past learnings to inform implementation

#### Scenario C: Bug Reports or Issues
```
User: "The database connection keeps failing"
```
**Before debugging:**
1. `/evermemos search "database connection error"`
2. `/evermemos search "connection bug fix"`
3. Check if similar issues were solved
4. Apply proven solutions first

#### Scenario D: Architecture or Design Questions
```
User: "Should we use microservices or monolith?"
```
**Before suggesting:**
1. `/evermemos search "architecture decision"`
2. `/evermemos search "design pattern choice"`
3. Check if architecture decisions were made
4. Respect past decisions and explain rationale

#### Scenario E: Code Review or Refactoring
```
User: "Review this authentication code"
```
**Before reviewing:**
1. `/evermemos search "authentication code review"`
2. `/evermemos search "auth security issue"`
3. Check past review comments
4. Apply learned patterns and avoid known issues

#### Scenario F: Configuration or Setup Questions
```
User: "How do I configure the database?"
```
**Before answering:**
1. `/evermemos search "database configuration"`
2. `/evermemos search "setup environment"`
3. Provide project-specific instructions
4. Don't give generic answers when specific history exists

### Search Decision Tree

```
User asks a question
    ↓
Is it about THIS project?
    ↓ YES → SEARCH FIRST (90% of cases)
    ↓ NO → Is it a general programming question?
        ↓ YES → Answer directly (but still consider project context)
        ↓ NO → SEARCH FIRST (be safe)

Examples:
✅ "How does this API work?" → SEARCH (project-specific)
✅ "Fix this bug" → SEARCH (check past bugs)
✅ "Implement feature X" → SEARCH (check past work)
✅ "Review this code" → SEARCH (check past reviews)
⚠️ "What is a REST API?" → CONSIDER: Any project-specific REST patterns?
❌ "Explain quantum physics" → DON'T SEARCH (unrelated)
```

### Default Behavior: **Search First**

**Golden Rule:** When in doubt, SEARCH!
- Searching unnecessarily costs a few seconds
- Missing important context costs hours of duplicated work or repeated mistakes
- **Bias toward searching, not toward skipping**

---

## Configuration

The skill uses environment variables (can be set in Claude Code settings or shell):

```bash
export EVERMEMOS_BASE_URL="http://localhost:1995"      # API endpoint
export EVERMEMOS_USER_ID="claude_code_user"            # User identifier
export EVERMEMOS_GROUP_ID="session_2026"               # Session/project identifier
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Search for Past Discussions

User: "What did we discuss about the ES sync bug?"

```bash
/evermemos search "ES sync bug" hybrid 5
```

Claude will:
1. Execute the search command
2. Parse the results
3. Summarize relevant past conversations
4. Provide context-aware response

---

### Example 2: Store Important Information

User: "Remember that we're using hybrid retrieval for this project"

```bash
/evermemos store "Project uses hybrid retrieval method for memory search" user
```

Claude confirms the information is stored for future reference.

---

### Example 3: Fetch Recent Context

User: "What were we working on earlier?"

```bash
/evermemos recent 15
```

Claude will:
1. Fetch the last 15 memories
2. Analyze the conversation flow
3. Summarize recent activities and tasks

---

### Example 4: Context-Aware Bug Fix

User: "There's a similar bug in the authentication module"

Claude should:
1. **Search:** `/evermemos search "authentication bug" hybrid 5`
2. Recall previous similar bugs and fixes
3. Apply learned patterns to the new issue
4. **Store:** Save the new bug and fix for future reference

---

### Example 5: Project Onboarding

User: "What's the architecture of this project?"

Claude should:
1. **Search:** `/evermemos search "architecture design patterns" hybrid 10`
2. **Search:** `/evermemos search "project structure" hybrid 10`
3. Synthesize information from past discussions
4. Provide comprehensive overview

---

## Workflow Integration

### Before Implementing Features
1. Search for related past work: `/evermemos search "<feature name>"`
2. Check for previous decisions: `/evermemos search "design decision <topic>"`
3. Look for known issues: `/evermemos search "bug <related area>"`

### After Completing Work
1. Store important decisions made
2. Document bugs discovered and fixed
3. Record new patterns or approaches used

### During Code Review
1. Search for related past reviews
2. Check for known issues in similar code
3. Apply lessons from previous feedback

---

## Technical Details

### Memory Types
- `episodic_memory`: Conversation messages and interactions
- `event_log`: System events and actions
- `foresight`: Future plans and predictions

### Retrieval Methods
- `keyword`: Traditional text search (fast, exact matches)
- `vector`: Semantic similarity search (understands meaning)
- `hybrid`: Combines keyword + vector (balanced, recommended)
- `rrf`: Reciprocal Rank Fusion (advanced ranking)
- `agentic`: AI-powered intelligent retrieval

---

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
If you see "Connection Error", check:
1. EverMemOS backend is running: `curl http://localhost:1995`
2. Correct `EVERMEMOS_BASE_URL` is set
3. Network/firewall settings

### No Results Found
- Try different search terms
- Use `hybrid` or `vector` method for semantic search
- Increase `top_k` to get more results
- Verify data exists for the current `user_id` and `group_id`

### Permission Errors
- Ensure the Python script is executable: `chmod +x ~/.claude/skills/evermemos/scripts/evermemos_client.py`
- Check Python 3 is installed: `python3 --version`

---

## Advanced Usage

### Multi-Query Search Pattern

For complex questions, perform multiple searches:

```bash
# Search for feature
/evermemos search "user authentication" hybrid 5

# Search for related bugs
/evermemos search "auth bug fix" hybrid 5

# Search for design decisions
/evermemos search "auth design pattern" hybrid 5
```

Then synthesize all results to provide comprehensive answer.

---

### Session-Specific Groups

Change `GROUP_ID` to organize memories by project or session:

```bash
export EVERMEMOS_GROUP_ID="project_alpha"     # For project Alpha
export EVERMEMOS_GROUP_ID="bugfix_session"    # For bug fixing session
export EVERMEMOS_GROUP_ID="feature_dev"       # For feature development
```

This allows context isolation between different work streams.

## Best Practices

### 🎯 Primary Principle: SEARCH FIRST, ANSWER SECOND

1. **ALWAYS Search First**: Before answering ANY question about this project:
   - Search for past discussions on the topic
   - Search for related bugs or issues
   - Search for design decisions
   - Search for similar implementations
   - **When in doubt, search!** It's better to search unnecessarily than miss important context

2. **Be Proactive, Not Reactive**: Don't wait for users to say "remember when...":
   - If user asks about a feature → Search for it first
   - If user reports a bug → Search for similar bugs
   - If user wants implementation → Search for past patterns
   - **Assume all questions have historical context until proven otherwise**

3. **Store Structured Insights Automatically**: Store actionable summaries, not raw messages:
   - **Raw messages are auto-saved by hooks** - don't duplicate them
   - When you discover a bug → Store structured bug report with solution
   - When a decision is made → Store the decision summary with rationale
   - When you learn something new → Store the key learning as a fact
   - When you implement a pattern → Store pattern description with use case
   - **Store as "assistant" role** - these are AI-generated insights
   - **Don't just acknowledge, actually store structured info**

4. **Use Appropriate Methods**:
   - Use `hybrid` for general searches (default, recommended)
   - Use `vector` for semantic/conceptual searches
   - Use `keyword` for exact term matching
   - Use `agentic` for complex queries requiring reasoning

5. **Multi-Query Pattern for Complex Questions**:
   ```bash
   # Don't just search once - search multiple angles!
   /evermemos search "authentication implementation"
   /evermemos search "auth bug fix"
   /evermemos search "security pattern"
   ```
   Then synthesize all results for comprehensive answer

6. **Provide Context with Citations**: When using retrieved memories:
   - Cite timestamps and sources
   - Reference specific past decisions
   - Explain why past context is relevant
   - Connect current question to historical patterns

7. **Regular Context Refresh**:
   - At start of complex tasks: `/evermemos recent 20`
   - Before major implementations: Search for related work
   - When resuming after break: Review recent history
   - **Maintain continuity across sessions**

8. **Verify Assumptions Against History**:
   - Before suggesting "Let's use approach X" → Search if we tried X before
   - Before implementing pattern Y → Search if Y is our convention
   - Before debugging → Search if similar issues were solved
   - **Learn from past experience, don't repeat mistakes**

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to AVOID

❌ **DON'T**: Answer technical questions without checking history first
✅ **DO**: Search → Review → Answer with context

❌ **DON'T**: Only search when user explicitly mentions past
✅ **DO**: Proactively search for any project-related question

❌ **DON'T**: Store raw user messages with `/evermemos store`
✅ **DO**: User messages are auto-saved by hooks. Store structured insights only.

**Example of duplication mistake:**
```
User: "Remember that we use hybrid retrieval"

❌ BAD: /evermemos store "Remember that we use hybrid retrieval" user
   (Duplicates the auto-saved user message!)

✅ GOOD: /evermemos store "Configuration: Project uses hybrid retrieval as default search method (balances speed and semantic accuracy)" assistant
   (Stores a structured, searchable fact)
```

❌ **DON'T**: Search only once and give up if no results
✅ **DO**: Try multiple search queries with different keywords

❌ **DON'T**: Ignore SessionStart context
✅ **DO**: Review the loaded memories and reference them when relevant
